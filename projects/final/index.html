                    <p>Each semester, M.J. candidates graduating from the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the
                        University of Maryland, College Park are required to participate in MJ Day. The exercise
                        requires M.J. candidates to individually recruit a panel consisting of three faculty members and
                        one alumnus. A portfolio, which includes published and unpublished clips, a resume and cover
                        letter, is the basis from which each candidate’s panel will provide feedback and recommendations
                        as they prepare to enter the workforce. </p>
                    </p>

                    <p>MJ Day falls on May 9 this year. The first panels convene at 9 a.m. and run through
                        mid-afternoon.</p>

                            <p>Once together, it took little to no time for the group of strangers to connect and
                                solidify friendships while navigating a new environment together. Between them all was a
                                deep respect for each other and a shared goal of telling stories as best and honest as

                                I'll be seeing bylines at some of the best publications and TV stations in the world and
                                think 'I can't believe I went to grad school with them," said Fall 2024 graduate Shaun

                    <p>An analysis of the cohort's programming revealed Adam Marton to be their top choice for panel
                        feedback with six scheduled panel appearances. Tied for second are Derek Willis, Christi Parsons
                        and Alana Delfino Kopania with five scheduled panel appearances. Mel Coffee, Kevin Blackistone
                        and Kathy Best are tied for third with four panels each.</p>

                    <p>That Marton and Willis, both instructors in various data-related classes, ranked high among the
                        graduating cohort’s choices for feedback is not surprising – over half of the 18 multiplatform
                        masters students cite data as part of their specialization or spent time in the CNS data bureau.
                        Their data colleagues Sean Mussenden and Rob Wells will also appear on panels, three and two
                        respectively.</p>

                    <p>All CNS bureau chiefs -- Marton of the data and graphics bureau, Parsons of the Annapolis bureau,
                        Jim Carroll of the D.C. bureau and Coffee of the broadcast bureau -- will join at least two
                        panels.</p>

                    <p>Kathy Best, director of the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, will appear on four of
                        eight panels for students involved in investigative projects over the last two school years.</p>
