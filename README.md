# Site notes:
First, I decided to exclude the "photo" and "applications" pages because neither have publishable content right now. I plan to add them on as I build those skills out.

## About me:
<li>Bio photo is <i>old</i>. I included it because the color scheme matches the background image. This will be updated...as soon as I get my roots redone.</li>
<li>Not very dynamic -- phone views are probably the worst. Would appreciate some feedback on how to make those look better.</li>

## Print:
<li>I removed the search bar and filters for now. I think those would work on WordPress best since WordPress allows you to assign tags to your work and houses your actual article text.</li>
<li>(This is me just giving myself more Illustrator work, BUT) I'm thinking of redoing all the thumbnail images so they compliment the site's color theme -- thoughts?</li>
<li>I coudldn't figure out how to increase the space between the bottom clip boards and footer. I tried in a couple of places but saw nothing change so I removed the code line.</li>

## Contact:
<li>I still need to figure out how to make the sumbit button work so that a message is actually generated from the completed form and sent to my school email. Maybe I should just remove the form and add a little envelope icon that links to mailto:[email address]?</li>
